Use the following data for question 1-5

.data
val1  BYTE  10h
val2  WORD  8000h
val3  DWORD 0FFFFh
val4  WORD  7FFFh

1. Write an instruction that increments val2.

2. Write an instruction that subtracts val3 from EAX.

3. Write instructions that subtract val4 from val2.

4. If val2 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Carry and Sign flags?

5. If val4 is incremented by 1 using the ADD instruction, what will be the values of the Overflow and Sign flags?

6. Where indicated, write down the values of the Carry, Sign, Zero, and Overflow flags after each instruction has executed:
      
      mov ax, 7FF0h
      add a1, 10h ;a. CF=     SF=     ZF=     OF=
      add ah, 1   ;b. CF=     SF=     ZF=     OF=
      add ax, 2   ;c. CF=     SF=     ZF=     OF=
